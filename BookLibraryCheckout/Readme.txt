Program for ABC Book Company

This program will help ABC Book Company manage their books more efficiently.This program allows both employees and 
patrons to checkout, find, and list books. The book list itself is imported from the books.txt file and any changes/ checkouts
is saved and exported to the same file.

The menu options are explained here:
1.	Checkout a book.
•	Allows a patron to checkout a book using its ISBN. If the book is unavailable, the user will be informed and the 
program will return back to the main menu. Otherwise, if the book is available, the available count will be decremented and 
the book information will be displayed.

2.	Find books by title.
•	Allows a patron to enter a search term and the program will display a list of books that have a title matching the 
search term.

3.	Display books of a specific type.
•	Allows a patron to view a list of books with a specific type. The user will also enter a format, diet, genre, or 
frequency (depending on the type of book) and the book list will be narrowed down further.

4.	Produce a list of random books.
•	Allows a patron to print a list of random books. The list of books can contain any type of book.


The program can be run by opening the jar file through the command prompt.
